This code demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Scala when using a secondary constructor and attempting to assign null to a type parameter that may not be a reference type.  The main problem is that null cannot be cast to value types. This can lead to ClassCastException or other runtime issues. The solution shows how to handle this appropriately.
